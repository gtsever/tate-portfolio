        <h3>More about me.</h3>
        <p>I have devoted both my personal life and professional career to absorbing all technology has to offer, wether it be the next new piece of software, database systems, or simply just building myself a new computer. However, I have hobbies (sometimes!).</p>

        <h1>Photography</h1>
        <h3>A collection of points in time.</h3>
        <p>If I'm not behind a screen, you might find me out in the world shooting photos. I shoot on both 35mm film and digital - but these days, mostly digital. Below are some of my best shots.</p>

        <h1>Manson</h1>
        <h3>For you cat people out there.</h3>
        <p>I met Manson in 2022 through my best friend, Tina, his previous owner. From the moment I met him, I knew he was my "soul cat." In December 2024, Tina had an abrupt change in her living situation and could no longer keep him. Just two days before Christmas, Manson officially became mine. Beyond being my companion, Manson has played an unexpected role in my workâ€”serving as the subject for countless projects and coding filler-images in my studies. This section is dedicated to him: my heart, my soul, my Manson.</p>
